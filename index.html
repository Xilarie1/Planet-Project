        <p>
          Neptune is the third biggest planet of the solar system and the eighth
          and outmost planet from the sun. It is too far from Earth to be seen
          with the naked eye, though it might be spotted with a small telescope.
        </p>
        <p>
          Named after the Roman god of the sea, and identified with the Greek
          deity Poseidon, Neptune is the second planet to have been found by
          telescope. Its discovery combined Newtonian physics with a a
          numerological scheme which was not founded by science. Neptune's orbit
          is almost circular, unlike the nearby dwarf planet Pluto. This means
          that for 20 years of its 164 period revolution, Neptune is actually
          further away from the sun than Pluto.
        </p>
        <h3>Basic astronomy</h3>
        <p>
          With an orbital period 164.79 times Earth's, Neptune has circled the
          Sun once since it was discovered in 1846. We therefore expect
          astronomers to further refine calculations of its orbit well into this
          century. After Voyager 2 encountered the planet its distance has been
          revised and is now estimated at 4.5&thinsp;Tm. (Terrametres) The shape
          of Neptune's orbit is the second closest to circular in our solar
          system. Only Venus has a more circular orbit. This circularity, in
          combination with the planet's rotational axis of 29.6&deg; gives
          Neptune seasons of almost equal length, at approxomately 41 Earth
          years each.
        </p>
        <h3>The atmosphere</h3>
        <p>
          Like other giant planets, Neptune has a thick atmosphere composed
          primarily of hydrogen and helium, with a small amount of methane.
          While hydrogen and helium are nearly invisible, methane absorbs red
          light and reflects blue light, and should give Neptune a blue-green
          colour similar to Uranus. However, Neptune's atmosphere is much more
          dynamic than Uranus', presumably due to an unidentified gas in the
          atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>
          As on Earth, the temperature in Neptune's atmosphere varies by
          altitude. The range is much greater, with a minimum temperature of
          50&thinsp;K, or -223&thinsp;&deg;C at a pressure of 0.1&thinsp;bar. As
          the altitude increases the pressure decreases, so at 2&thinsp;Mm above
          the 1 bar level, the temperature is 480&thinsp;&deg;C and the pressure
          is .1&thinsp;µbar. Near the centre of the planet, the temperature is
          7&thinsp;kK, and the pressure may reach 5&thinsp;Mbar. The whole
          planet has an effective temperature of -214&thinsp;&deg;C. The mean
          temperature at 1 bar is roughly 74&thinsp;K, or -199&thinsp;&deg;C.
          The atmosphere is a little warmer at equator and the poles than
          mid-latitudes. Like other giant planets, the winds in Neptune's
          atmosphere circulate along constant lattitudes. Winds range from
          around 100&thinsp;m&frasl;s at 70&deg;&thinsp;S to
          700&thinsp;m&frasl;s at 20&deg;&thinsp;S.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Neptune is more than 50% further from the sun than Uranus and
          receives half as much sunlight, the two planets' effective
          temperatures are almost the same. Both planets absorb and reflect
          roughly the same proportion of the sunlight that reaches them. For
          reasons unknown, Neptune emits more than twice as much energy as it
          receives from the Sun, which must be generated in its interior. By
          contrast, little energy escapes Uranus.
