        <h1>Neptune</h1>
        <h2>The Celestial Dreamscape</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to the farthest frontier of the solar system—a planet that
          defies reality! Neptune is known not just for its deep blue hue but
          for its surreal landscapes that shift like waves beneath an endless
          cosmic sky. Unlike any other planet, Neptune's surface glows with
          bioluminescent storms, creating a mesmerizing dance of neon blues and
          purples across its ever-changing terrain. Here, gravity operates in
          unpredictable waves, allowing objects to float momentarily before
          softly sinking back down. Scientists speculate that Neptune’s air
          holds trace elements of cosmic dust—making every breath feel like
          inhaling the universe itself.

        <h1>Neptune's Floating Cities</h1>
        <h2>A futuristic utopia</h2>
        <p>Suspended above the swirling depths of Neptune’s atmosphere, futuristic floating cities serve as havens for intergalactic explorers. These massive hubs, built from energy-absorbing crystal structures, harness Neptune’s wild winds to generate unlimited power. No need for roads—residents navigate the sky in personal hover pods, weaving through glowing mist trails left behind by the planet’s enigmatic storms. The temperature inside the floating cities is maintained by Neptune’s mysterious thermal currents, ensuring a perfect climate for human habitation. Legends say that Neptune’s shimmering skyline can change colors depending on the emotions of its inhabitants—a living city reflecting the heartbeats of those who call it home.</p>
