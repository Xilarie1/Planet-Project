          <h1>Neptune</h1>
          <h2>Structure</h2>
          <p>
            Neptune is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the
            other is Uranus). Most (80% or more) of the planet's mass is made up
            of a hot dense fluid of <q>icy</q> materials &mdash; water, methane,
            and ammonia &mdash; above a small, rocky core. Of the giant planets,
            Neptune is the densest. Scientists think there might be an ocean of
            super hot water under Neptune's cold clouds. It does not boil away
            because incredibly high pressure keeps it locked inside.
            <br />
            <br />
            Neptune does not have a solid surface. Its atmosphere (made up
            mostly of hydrogen, helium, and methane) extends to great depths,
            gradually merging into water and other melted ices over a heavier,
            solid core with about the same mass as Earth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Neptune's atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen and helium with
            just a little bit of methane. Neptune's neighbor Uranus has a
            similar makeup; the methane absorbs other colors but reflects blue,
            giving these ice giants their similar hue. Many images of Neptune,
            coming from the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989, show Neptune as a much
            deeper blue. This was because the Voyager team tweaked the images,
            to better reveal clouds and other distinctive features on the
            planet, compared to the hazy, uniform view of Uranus that Voyager 2
            had captured in 1986. Researchers in 2024 re-processed the images,
            showing the planets look much more alike than many thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            Neptune is our solar system's windiest world. Despite its great
            distance and low energy input from the Sun, Neptune's winds can be
            three times stronger than Jupiter's and nine times stronger than
            Earth's. These winds whip clouds of frozen methane across the planet
            at speeds of more than 1,200 miles per hour (2,000 kilometers per
            hour). Even Earth's most powerful winds hit only about 250 miles per
            hour (400 kilometers per hour). In 1989 a large, oval-shaped storm
            in Neptune's southern hemisphere dubbed the "Great Dark Spot" was
            large enough to contain the entire Earth. That storm has since
            disappeared, but new ones have appeared on different parts of the
            planet.
